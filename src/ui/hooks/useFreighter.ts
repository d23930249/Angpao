/**
 * Race a Freighter API call against a timeout. The documented
 * behavior is that `isConnected()` resolves with
 * `{ isConnected: false }` for users without the extension
 * (Connecting_Freight.md), but the message-passing layer can still
 * hang in edge cases (content script never responds, extension
 * disabled mid-load, etc.). The timeout is a safety net that forces
 * the hook to settle so the UI can degrade to the "Install
 * Freighter" branch instead of a permanent skeleton.
